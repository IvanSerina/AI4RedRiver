## Synthetic Datasets

The currently available datasets have been generated based on historical data collected between 1989 and 2022. For each year, the datasets include key values related to tributary inflows, flows, and other relevant parameters of the basin system—such as water levels at the Hoa Binh dam and in the river at Hanoi.

To generate the synthetic datasets, a time interval was selected and the mean values of the variables of interest were computed over that period. Random noise was then added to these mean values, based on the standard deviation of the original data and sampled from a normal (Gaussian) distribution.

Using the same approach, additional datasets were generated by introducing controlled variations to specific parameters. For instance, we created versions in which the dam storage or the inflows from the three main tributaries were increased or decreased by a given percentage. In other cases, multiple modifications were combined to simulate more complex scenarios—such as a reduction in reservoir storage accompanied by an increase in water demand.

## Historical data

The historical data used as the basis for generating the synthetic datasets spans from 1989 to 2022. Each record in the dataset corresponds to a single day and includes a series of environmental and operational variables related to water resource management and energy production. The main features included in the dataset are:

- **Date**: the reference date for the record (format `YYYY-MM-DD`)
- **Input_Hoa_Binh**: daily total inflow to the Hoa Binh dam (in m³/s)
- **Yen_Bai**, **Vu_Quang**: daily inflow contributions from the Yen Bai and Vu Quang tributaries (in m³/s)
- **Evaporation**: daily estimate of evaporation
- **Demand**: total daily water demand (in m³/s)
- **H_Up (m)**: upstream water level at the dam (in meters)
- **Energy_demand**: estimated daily energy demand
- **Qtu_ (m³/s)**: water released through the turbines (in m³/s)
- **Qbot_ (m³/s)**: water released through the bottom gates (in m³/s)
- **Qspill_ (m³/s)**: water released through the spillways gates (in m³/s)
- **Q_Sơn Tây**, **Q_Hà Nội**: flow rates measured at the Sơn Tây and Hà Nội monitoring stations (in m³/s)
- **H_Hà Nội**: river water level at Hà Nội (in centimeters)

These variables were used to model the behavior of the water system, accounting for both natural inputs (such as inflows) and human demands (such as water usage and energy needs).
